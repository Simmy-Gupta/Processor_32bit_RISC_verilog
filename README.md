# Processor_32bit_RISC_verilog

This is a simple RISC 32 bit processor made using Verilog.
This is based on the idea provided by smruti ranjan sarangi sir(IIT Delhi,Computer organisation and Architecture).


----------------------------------------------------------
* The program has to be written in "program.asm" file in 
assembly language.
* The Hex file is "Input_Memory" which is read by the processor.
* The output i.e. Updated register file and updated memory is stored in "Updated_Memory" file.
----------------------------------------------------------
* The simulation time can be varied from the test processor file.
